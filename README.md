## Project Overview
The Bike Sales Dashboard is an interactive Excel dashboard created to analyze customer purchasing behavior for a bike sales company. This project aimed to identify key factors influencing bike purchases, including income levels, commute distances, marital status, gender, region, and education levels.
The dashboard provides a filterable, real-time view of key metrics, allowing sales and marketing teams to segment customers and identify profitable target groups. This project highlights my proficiency in Excel data cleaning, advanced formula writing, pivot tables, slicers, and dashboard design.

## Step 1: Data Import and Cleaning
Before designing the dashboard, I performed comprehensive data cleaning and transformation using Excel:
## Data Cleaning Tasks:
•	Removed Duplicates: Ensured data consistency and avoided double counting.

•	Standardized Marital Status and Gender Columns:

o	"M" → Married, "S" → Single

o	"M" → Male, "F" → Female

•	Created Age Brackets: Applied nested IF statements to group customers into:
o	Adolescent (Below 25)
o	Middle Age (25-50)
o	Old (50+)

These cleaning steps ensured the data was accurate, structured, and ready for analysis, enabling consistent segment-based insights across visualizations.

## Step 2: Dashboard Development
With cleaned data, I built a multi-section dashboard using pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers to give end-users full control over filtering and analysis. The dashboard provides both overview trends and deep drilldowns, allowing users to uncover key purchase drivers.

## Key Visualizations:
1️. Average Income Per Purchase (Bar Chart)

Compares average income of customers who purchased bikes vs. those who didn’t, split by gender. This reveals the income range of potential buyers.

2️. Commute Distance Per Customer (Line Chart)

Plots commute distance against purchase status, showing how customers with shorter commutes are more likely to buy bikes.

3️. Customer Age Brackets (Line Chart)

Displays bike purchases across different age groups, highlighting that middle-aged customers drive the highest sales.

## Step 3: Interactive Slicers for Real-Time Analysis

I added slicers to filter data by:

•	Marital Status

•	Region

•	Education Level

This empowers users to instantly filter and explore specific customer segments, such as:

•	Married customers in North America with Graduate Degrees.

•	Younger customers in Europe with High School education.

•	Regional comparisons for targeting underperforming markets.

## Key Insights Derived
•	Married customers are more likely to purchase bikes compared to single customers.

•	Higher-income males with short commutes make up a profitable customer segment.

•	Middle-aged buyers dominate bike purchases across all regions.

•	Customers with longer commutes tend to avoid bike purchases, indicating they may favor cars or public transport instead.

## Step 4: Business Value Delivered
This dashboard serves as a self-service analytical tool for sales and marketing teams to:

•	Identify top customer segments for targeted campaigns.

•	Refine pricing strategies based on income brackets.

•	Tailor promotions for specific age groups and regions.

•	Analyze educational and marital trends to customize outreach messaging.
